#### <u>Water quality and recreational angling demand</u>
*Using a fixed-effect model and a large repeated cross-section, we decompose the within- and between- effects of water quality changes on angler behavior, and elicit a willingness-to-pay for long- and short-term changes in water quality.*

#### <u>Optimal management of an ambiguous good under conflicting management objectives</u>
*Using a spatial-dynamic model with conflicting objective functions, we specify and solve a two-player game under cooperation and non-cooperationof a mobile resource that is considered both a public good and public bad.*
